# **Welcome to Horiseon**

## *Horiseon.com* is the website with thorough accessibility standards optimized for today's search engines which aims to add credibility and clarity of communication for the marketing agency Horiseon as well as push business and make a lot of money for *Horiseon*

The first thing that I did was scan the *html* code for excessive and confusing *"div"* tags and replace them with more specific and descriptive *html* tags for clarity. Then, I consolidated the *css* classes with exact properties to reduce clutter and redundancy. Then, I referenced the given website mock-up to make sure that my version matched. 

One of the issues I ran into was that the navigation links weren't in the right place. I figured out that I had to make the *html* tags I had replaced earlier and *css* class names agree and that worked. 

I also learned about the *"aside"* *html* tag which more accurately described what the section at the bottom-right of the website was doing.
