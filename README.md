# **Welcome to Horiseon**

## *Horiseon.com* is the website with thorough accessibility standards optimized for today's search engines which aims to add credibility and clarity of communication for the marketing agency **Horiseon** as well as push business and make a lot of money for **Horiseon**.

### The first thing that I did was scan the *html* code for excessive and confusing <*div*> tags and replace them with more specific and descriptive *html* tags for clarity. Then, I consolidated the *css* classes with exact properties to reduce clutter and redundancy. Then, I referenced the given website mock-up to make sure that my version matched. 

#### One of the issues I ran into was that the navigation links were not in the right place (they were stacked instead of in-line). I figured out that I had to make the *html* tags, I had replaced earlier, and the *css* class names agree; that fixed the issue. 

#### I also learned about the <*aside*> *html* tag which more accurately described what the section at the bottom-right of the website was doing.

##### In the end, we have a polished, professional, and accessible website. 

###### For help I used: [README Markdown guide] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and (https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-links/) as well as (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#problems_solved_by_html5)
